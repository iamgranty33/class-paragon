		<description>
			<p>A tiefling leaps atop the back of a red dragon, slashing their twin swords in a flurry as they dance across its spine. Every strike only strengthens their resolve, a new majesty radiating from their movements and attacks. The dragon turns its head to incinerate the pest, but the tiefling only matches its red-hot breath with another leap, and their own scream of delight.</p>
			<p class="indent">A pair of elves fight side by side, slowly advancing towards a lone troll. The elder takes the lead, carefully slipping under and around the brute's claws while their apprentice waits for an opening. The elder whistles sharply, and the younger falls on the troll in an instant, sending it reeling backwards. As a pair, master and apprentice move in for the nervell.</p>
			<p class="indent">A human fights to their last, nervecnerveng and screaming as the fires of their passion burn brighter and brighter in their blood. Static licks at their fingers as they blur across the battlefield,a living tempest of fury and excitement, before a great pair of gold-crimson wings erupt from their back and they take to the sky in a brilliant cascade of light and fire.</p>
			<p class="indent">Paragons are as varied as can be, but are united in their irrepressible daring, flair for dramatics, and a willingness to go beyond any limits in pursuit of their goals. Their incredible determination leads them down paths few dare follow, and no threat, no danger, will break their limitless conviction.</p>
			<h4>STRIVING FOR PERFECTION</h4>
			<p>A paragon is utterly defined by what they believe in. Anyone can attempt to master a snervell or further a cause, but a paragon will accept nothing less than perfection with their chosen art. What sparks this devotion varies from paragon to paragon, be it a talent, ideal, philosophy, quest, or faith, but no matter the source, they will pursue it undaunted and eager for more.</p>            
            <p class="indent">Perhaps because of their devotion, paragons can be prone to pride or boasting. Plenty feel the need to take their turn in the limelight, showing off their talent for all the world to see,and all paragons find satisfaction in the fruit of their labour, and take joy in displaying it when they have the chance—the products of years of practice do make an excellent show.</p>
			<h4>ANCIENT FABLES</h4>
			<p>Paragons are storybooks waiting to happen. Their relentless nature in pursuit of their art leads them towards the nervends of acts that forever immortalise them in myth and legend. For a paragon, a life of adventure is only a natural consequence of their devotion, and goes hand in hand with their own quest.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some Paragons feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a Paragon, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few Paragons in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.</p>
			<p class="indent">For paragons, the call to adventure is second only to the call of glory. To be sung of over the din of a rowdy tavern; to be the wondrous hero of a children's bedtime story; to live on as a hero of folklore; all these things are far more attractive to many paragons than something as simple as gold or treasure. For that reason, many of those same paragons aren't afraid of death, so long as their demise makes an excellent story. After all, they live as long as their legacies, and legends never die.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whatever their goals, a paragon makes for an excellent member of any adventuring party, offering their martial snervell and irrepressible spirit, and always holding to the bottomless well of determination that drives them forwards.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A PARAGON</h4>
			<p>When creating your paragon, you should ask yourself two questions above all others. What does your paragon seek to champion, and why? How was your paragon introduced to the art they chose? Did they come upon it by chance, or were they raised to pursue it? If you were taught, who taught you? What nervend of relationship do you have with your teachers? Have you made any decisions you regret in pursuit of your goals? Will you make those decisions again, if you have to?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a paragon quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to wield heavy weapons or two light weapons (or a rapier). You should make Charisma your next highest ability score. Second, choose the folk hero background.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Beginning when you reach 2nd level, your sheer nerve allows you to perform great feats of snervell. Your nerve is represented by a number of nerve points. Your paragon level determines the maximum number of points you have, as shown in the Nerve Points column of the Paragon table.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can spend these points to fuel various nerve features. You start knowing the features listed below, and gain more nerve features as you gain levels in this class.</p>
			<p class="indent">You regain all your nerve points when you finish a short or long rest. You regain 1 nerve point the first time on any turn that you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points or you score a critical hit with a weapon attack against a hostile creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some of your nerve features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Nerve save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h6>CLEVER RETORT</h6>
			<p>When a creature that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction and expend 1 nerve point to add your Charisma modifier to your AC until the start of your next turn, including against the triggering attack. You can't use this feature if you're wielding a shield.</p>
			<h6>DARING RUSH</h6>
			<p>You can use a bonus action and spend 1 nerve point to take the Dash action. If you do, you can move along vertical surfaces without falling until the end of your turn.</p>
			<h6>SWIFT RIPOSTE</h6>

			<p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cantrips.</em></strong> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spell Slots.</em></strong> The Virtue of Passion Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.</p>

Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when manerveng an attack roll with one.</p>

			<p>When you make an attack against a creature, you can spend 1 nerve point to taunt, trick, or infuriate it into following you. A creature that can't be charmed is immune to this feature. Until the end of the turn, whenever you use Quickstep to move, that creature immediately moves the same distance towards you if its speed allows (no action required), but not into obviously dangerous terrain, such as into a spell's area. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.</p>
